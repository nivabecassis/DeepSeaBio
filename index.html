            Nessie, the Leviathan, Moby Dick, mermaids, and countless more like them have
            intrigued people for centuries. Since the very beginning, tales of mythical
            dangerous monsters lurking in the waters, ready to lead sailors to their doom
            and engulf ships have occupied folklore all around the world. Not surprising,
            seeing as the ocean has always been a source of awe, inspiration, fear, and
            downright mystery to humans. Even today, when discoveries are made on the daily
            regarding the ecosystem that makes up 71% of Earth’s surface, less than 5% of
            it has been explored. With pressures that can be up to a thousand times stronger
            than those at sea level, pitch black darkness all around, and depths going up
            to 11000 meters in a region known as Mariana’s Trench, the deep sea is by far
            the most fascinating part of our oceans.

            In such conditions, one would think that nothing could survive. But no. Like
            something straight out of science fiction, life finds a way. Indeed, a rich
            and colourful ecosystem prevails with creatures that seem to come out of outer
            space— and this website provides a riveting repertoire of it. So suit up, and
            get ready to dive into world that will change everything you thought you knew
            about our planet Earth.

          My name is Valentina Ceballos and I am the writer for this website. I am a
          PADI certified scuba diver since 2015, I studied Health Sciences in First
          Choice at Dawson College, Montreal, and will be attending Dalhousie University
          in Halifax in 2019 to pursue an major in Marine Biology. My aim is for
          this website to convey just how fascinating I find the deep sea and how
          passionate I am about anything related to the oceans, their conservation,
          and the scientific research done to understand them further. Hopefully this
          while pique your curiosity too and you will be tempted to find out more about
          this riveting world through any of the aforementioned sites. I wish you an
          instructive and enjoyable reading!
