          The deep sea is defined as the part of the ocean that is below 200 meters
          in depth. Surprisingly, against all expectations, this world is full of
          unique creatures that have found a way to circumvent the harsh conditions
          of the abyss and, as we go deeper and deeper, more mysteries unfold and
          creatures who have never before seen the light of day make their appearance,
          then disappear just as swiftly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But lets start at the beginning, with an important phenomena that plays
          a role in the vast majority, if not all, of deep sea marine ecosystems,
          down to the very bottom of the sea: marine snow.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Marine snow, as the National Ocean Service of the US National Oceanic and
          Atmospheric Administration puts it, is the shower of organic material
          falling from upper waters to the deep ocean. Briefly, as marine organisms
          near the surface of the ocean die and begin to decay, they start to fall
          toward the ocean floor, along with other inorganic material from the
          ecosystems and, all together, appear as a light snowfall. The “snowflakes”
          grow as they fall, sometimes reaching several centimetres in diameter.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          include video or GIF preferably
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Eventually, after weeks, the snowfall reach the seabed where it will
          serve as a key food source for multiple deep sea organisms. Throughout
          its fall, however, it will encounter a myriad of creatures swimming about…

          <p>
            <span class="animal_name">Japanese Spider Crab</span>: This crab that lives
            off of the waters of Japan has the largest leg span of any arthropod, averaging at 5.5m across. Their
            predators include octopuses, and, to protect itself, the spider crab will
            often camouflage itself onto the ocean floor, decorating its shell with
            sponges and other animals to blend in further.

            <span class="animal_name">Giant Squid</span>: The Giant Squid, unsurprisingly,
            can grow to enormous sizes. Males are found to be up to 13 meters in length, excluding its two tentacles
            that extend past its other eight arms. Its arms and tentacles are armed
            with thousands of suction cups, some specimen have been documented to weigh
            over 100kg, and, to top it all off, much like its close relative, the
            Colossal Squid, are known to hunt Sperm Whales.

            <span class="animal_name">Big Red Jellyfish (Tiburonia)</span>: Unlike most jellies,
            this one does not have long, thin tentacles, but rather, big fleshy arms and is a bright red colour,
            a very unusual characteristic for deep sea animals. Since it was first
            discovered in 2003, only 23 have been found.

            <span class="animal_name">Barreleye</span>: Also known as spook fish, this creature has barrel-shaped, tubular
            eyes that usually point towards the water surface, through its transparent
            head, to detect its prey’s silhouette.

            <span class="animal_name">Pacific Blackdragon</span>: This unique predator reaches 60cm in length and has
            its entire stomach covered in thick, black skin so as to prevent any light
            from bioluminescent animals that they eat. The extension on its chin possesses
            photophores that are believed to be used to attract mates.

            <span class="animal_name">Phronima</span>: Stop me if this sounds familiar: it
            hollows out its prey, lays its eggs in their corpse, and then its babies come
            bursting out the victim’s body to start the whole process again. If the movie
            Aliens comes to mind, then this deep sea critter is exactly that. Indeed, Phronima,
            while small, transparent, and altogether seemingly innocent, are parasitoids who
            target plankton.

            <span class="animal_name">Fangtooth</span>: Famous for their disproportionately large
            fang-like teeth, these fish are surprisingly small, never exceeding 20cm in length, and,
            like many deep sea fish, swim to less deep sea levels in the evening to feed by starlight.
            While the young feed on zooplankton (plankton consisting of small, immature animals), the
            bigger, deeper-living adults will sometimes target other fish and squid.

            <span class="animal_name">Harp Sponge</span>: Also known as Lyre Sponge, this creature
            is exceptional for the way it feeds itself: unlike most sponges, it does not simply passively
            filter bacteria and plankton, but rather possesses velcro-like hooks that capture larger prey
            like crustaceans and a digestive membrane that will surround and engulf its victims, making
            it a carnivorous sponge.
