          The deep sea is defined as the part of the ocean that is below 200 meters
          in depth. Surprisingly, against all expectations, this world is full of
          unique creatures that have found a way to circumvent the harsh conditions
          of the abyss. As we go deeper and deeper, more mysteries unfold and
          creatures who have never before seen the light of day make their appearance,
          then disappear just as swiftly.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          But lets start at the beginning, with an important phenomena that plays
          a role in the vast majority, if not all, of deep sea marine ecosystems,
          down to the very bottom of the sea: marine snow.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Marine snow, as the National Ocean Service of the US National Oceanic and
          Atmospheric Administration puts it, is the shower of organic material
          falling from upper waters to the deep ocean. Briefly, as marine organisms
          near the surface of the ocean die and begin to decay, they start to fall
          toward the ocean floor, along with other inorganic material from the
          ecosystems and, all together, appear as a light snowfall. The “snowflakes”
          grow as they fall, sometimes reaching several centimetres in diameter.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Eventually, after weeks, the snowfall reaches the seabed where it will serve
          as a key food source for multiple deep sea organisms. Throughout its fall,
          however, it will encounter a myriad of creatures swimming about…

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_spider_crab"><span class="animal_name">Japanese Spider Crab</span></a>: This crab that lives
            off of the waters of Japan has the largest leg span of any arthropod, averaging at 5.5m across. Their
            predators include octopuses, and, to protect itself, the spider crab will
            often camouflage itself onto the ocean floor, decorating its shell with
            sponges and other animals to blend in further.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_squid"><span class="animal_name">Giant Squid</span></a>: The Giant Squid, unsurprisingly, can grow to
            enormous sizes. Males are found to be up to 13 meters in length, excluding its two tentacles
            that extend past its other eight arms. Its arms and tentacles are armed with thousands of
            suction cups, some specimen have been documented to weigh over 100kg, and, to top it all
            off, much like its close relative, the Colossal Squid, they are known to hunt Sperm Whales.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiburonia"><span class="animal_name">Big Red Jellyfish (Tiburonia)</span></a>: Unlike most jellies,
            this one does not have long, thin tentacles, but rather, big fleshy arms and is a bright red colour,
            a very unusual characteristic for deep sea animals. Since it was first
            discovered in 2003, only 23 have been found.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barreleye"><span class="animal_name">Barreleye</span></a>: Also known as spook fish, this creature has barrel-shaped, tubular
            eyes that usually point towards the water surface, through its transparent
            head, to detect its prey’s silhouette.

            <a href="http://oceana.org/marine-life/ocean-fishes/pacific-blackdragon"><span class="animal_name">Pacific Blackdragon</span></a>: This unique predator reaches
            60cm in length and has its entire stomach covered in thick, black skin so as to
            prevent any light from bioluminescent animals that they eat from coming through.
            The extension on its chin possesses photophores that are believed to be used to attract mates.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phronima"><span class="animal_name">Phronima</span></a>: Stop me if this sounds familiar: it
            hollows out its prey, lays its eggs in their corpse, and then its babies come
            bursting out the victim’s body to start the whole process again. If the movie
            Aliens comes to mind, then this deep sea critter is exactly that. Indeed, Phronima,
            while small, transparent, and altogether seemingly innocent, are parasitoids who
            target plankton to use as carriages for its offspring.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fangtooth"><span class="animal_name">Fangtooth</span></a>: Famous for their disproportionately large
            fang-like teeth, these fish are surprisingly small, never exceeding 20cm in length, and,
            like many deep sea fish, swim to less deep sea levels in the evening to feed by starlight.
            While the young feed on zooplankton (plankton consisting of small, immature animals), the
            bigger, deeper-living adults will sometimes target other fish and squid.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocladia_lyra"><span class="animal_name">Harp Sponge</span></a>: Also known as Lyre Sponge, this creature
            is exceptional for the way it feeds itself: unlike most sponges, it does not simply passively
            filter bacteria and plankton, but rather possesses velcro-like hooks that capture larger prey
            like crustaceans and a digestive membrane that will surround and engulf its victims, making
            it a carnivorous sponge.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riftia_pachyptila"><span class="animal_name">Giant Tube Worm</span></a>: Typically measuring two and a half
            meters in length, these invertebrates are found near hydrothermal vents and are thus
            incredible for their ability to withstand temperatures up to around 40 degrees Celsius,
            making them one of the most heat-resistant animals on Earth. The bacteria that make up
            almost half of their weight perform chemosynthesis.

          <p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_eel"><span class="animal_name">Pelican Eels</span></a>: These fish lack several bones, including
            ribs, which makes them quite different than any other species of eel. But most importantly,
            it possess large jaws lined with small teeth that, when extended, permit it to eat prey much
            larger than itself.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglerfish"><span class="animal_name">Angler Fish</span></a>: These predatory fish are known for the fleshy
            lure protruding from their head used to lure prey into their large, toothy mouths. There are
            different species of angler fish, all varying in shape and size depending on the depth at
            which they live, but species have been documented to live on the very bottom of the seafloor,
            and some have photophores on this lure, a mass of cells that produce bioluminescence, often
            thanks to light-producing bacteria.

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crinoid"><span class="animal_name">Crinoid</span></a>: Commonly called Sea Lilies, these animals can be found from shallow
            reefs to depths up to 9000 meters. They feed by filtering the sea water with their numerous
            arms. The ones that reside in the deep sea can have a stalk that reaches up to 1 meter in height
            and possess more highly branched arms due to the smaller amount of plankton available.

            elephant, this octopus has large ear-like fins extending from its head which it
            uses to propel itself through water. It is the deepest-living of all known octopus
            and usually grow to be 30cm in length, though the largest ever recorded reached
            almost 2 meters.

          The deepest part of the ocean is called the Hadalpelagic zone, from the Greek
          God of the Underworld, Hades, or, more commonly, The Trenches. Here, the pressure
          is about eight tons per square inch. Note that, in this regions, living organisms
          are still found, including  soft shell crustaceans and invertebrates such as starfish
          and sea cucumbers. In other words, this proves that nature can adapt to truly
          incredulous settings.
