          While humans have been navigating the oceans since the dawn of time, deep
          sea exploration is a relatively modern science that has only gained
          popularity in the last two hundred years.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h4>1800s</h4>
        <p>
          Back in the late nineteenth century, scientists mainly tried to measure
          the depth of the ocean thanks to the Thomson sounding machine, a device
          that was created by Sir Charles Wyville Thomson that was inspired by
          rudimentary viking technology. Indeed, back in the 700s, vikings used to
          drop lead weights attached to rope overboard and then measured how much
          robe had been underwater, but Thomson revolutionized this in 1872 by
          replacing the rope with a thin wire and a dial that measured how much
          of it had been dropped, which proved to be much more precise. Thomson
          also created a device called a dredge, which is basically a net that
          closes and scrapes the bottom of the sea. It was used to capture all
          forms of life on the seabed and therefore led to the discovery of
          thousands of species.

        <h4>1900s</h4>
        <p>
          With the sinking of the RMS Titanic in 1912, deep sea  exploration turned
          towards a collective effort of creating an acoustic mechanism that could
          detect objects in water and, thus, map the seafloor. In 1914, Reginald A.
          Fessenden created the Fessenden Oscillator, which used echo ranging, a
          technique where sound is issued and then detected as it bounces off objects.
          This was the precursor the the modern-day SONAR.
        </p>

          However, this wasn’t enough— people wanted to go down there themselves. Enter
          famous explorer Charles William Beebe. With the help of American inventor Otis
          Barton he built the first deep sea submersible, the Bathysphere. After years
          of testing, the Bathysphere, which was simply a hollow steel ball that carried
          eight hours worth of oxygen, was finally taken out, lowered by a cord, and
          reached a record-breaking 923 meters. With this, the race to the bottom of the
          sea began.

          In 1948, Barton teamed up with Swedish Balloonist Auguste Piccard. Together, they built
          the FRNS-2,  also dubbed the “submarine balloon”. It was essentially a  modified
          version of the Bathyscaphe, but, instead of being lowered by a boat on the surface,
          it floated on water and brought itself to the desirable depth when the heavy ballast
          was engaged, and rise back up when released. However, it failed sea trials and a new
          device had to be built. Finally, in 1949, with Barton’s Benthoscope (a modified
          version of the Bathyscaphe), Beebe’s record was finally broken. Humans had now been
          1372 meters underwater!
        </p>

          In 1953, with a new version of this submersible, the Trieste (built by Auguste Piccard
          and his son Jacques Piccard), incredible new depths were reached. In fact, it was
          brought down to a depth of 3.1 kilometres. The U.S. government was so impressed with
          this extraordinary feat that they bought the ship for themselves and, in 1960, the
          ultimate goal was reached: the deepest point in the ocean, Mariana Trench. With the
          help of Jacques Piccard, Navy Lieutenant Don Walsh navigated the Trieste down to
          11000 meters, effectively ending the race for depth.

          Continuing the search for a more efficient way of exploring the deep sea, the US Navy
          made a breakthrough in 1964 with Alvin, a submersible funded by the Woods Hole
          Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts and built by General Mills. It has been
          used for thousands of dives since then. One of its most famous expedition was on
          February 17 1977,  when Hydrothermal Vents and Giant Tube Worms were discovered.
          This was monumental, as it was the first time an ecosystem that thrived without
          the energy of the sun was documented.

          With the new emerging technology of the late loth century, numerous unmanned submersibles
          and robots were built, including, famously, Dr. Robert Ballard’s Argo. Ballard armed
          Argo with numerous high quality cameras and used them to search for sunken ships,
          like USS Scorpion and USS Thresher, on missions funded by the US Navy and helped by
          Woods Hole ships. On September 1st 1985, his fame is cemented when he discovers the
          bow and stern of the RMS Titanic, 3800 meters below the surface, 600 kilometres away
          from the coast of Newfoundland.

          Finally, at the end of the century, another great achievement occurs: using satellite
          radar technology, scientists Walter Smith and Dave Sandwall map the entirety of the
          world’s sea floor from space. This greatly enhances the previous data available and,
          all in all, taken mankind one step closer to understanding this Blue Planet.

        <h4>2000s</h4>
        <p>
          On January 6 2000, ecologists worldwide rejoice as US President George W. Bush
          established the Mariana Trench National Monument, effectively protecting more
          than 150 thousand square kilometres of rich marine habitats, including numerous
          hydrothermal vents.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In March 2012, Hollywood director James Cameron, famous for the movie Titanic
          starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, undergoes the second manned dive
          to the Mariana Trench using the Deeps Challenger. In doing so, he becomes the
          first person to solo dive to this depth and spends three hours gathering footage
          before returning to the surface.

          In the end, the history of research and exploration to the deep sea is long and
          full of riveting discoveries. To this day, new findings change science and
          continue to fuel people’s imagination and scientific curiosity. Of course it
          is full of many more interesting characters who have contributed in fascinating
          manners. For example, the iconic french conservationist, innovator, filmmaker,
          scientist, author, and researcher Jacques-Yves Cousteau. Cousteau, who is mostly
          known for his development of the Aqua-lung, the first successful, commercial
          SCUBA diving apparatus and his documentary The Silent World filmed aboard the
          Calypso (which won him a Palme d’Or), also contributed to deep sea exploration.
          Indeed, he participated in the Bathyscaphe’s dives and even built his own
          submersibles, which reached up to 500 meters in depth. But most importantly, it
          is through his charisma and with his constant communication with  the public that
          he has remained cemented in people’s minds and hearts. Without the Cousteau’s of
          the world, the deep sea would still be completely unexplored, and it just goes
          to show how incredible things can be achieved when there is passion.
