          You’ve probably seen pictures of the creatures that inhabit the deep sea
          at some point or another and been taken aback by how… well, weird they were.
          Be it an enormous squid, a human-sized crab, or a fish with teeth and eyes
          straight out of a Tim Burton horror story, these critters all look wildly
          different, not only from each other, of course, but from their marine
          relatives that live at less daunting depths. Why is this? The explanation
          behind the incredible sizes, colours, and shapes that they possess lies in
          evolution. Indeed, just like polar bears have evolved to be endowed with a
          thick fur to protect themselves from the cold, these beings have had to adapt
          to the immense pressure of their environment, for example. Furthermore,
          absolute darkness, temperatures that never surpass 3 degrees Celsius, and a
          notable lack of nutrients contribute to their strange morphology and physiology.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Thus, here are some remarkable phenomena and some scientific concepts that begin
          to explain why these creatures are so unique and provide a glimpse of the distinct
          world they live in.

        <h4>Deep sea gigantism</h4>
        <p>
          For some reason, it would seem like creatures of the abyss grow to sizes
          that defy logic. Unlike their shallow-water counterparts, deep sea Japanese
          spider crabs, for example, can measure up to 12 meters from claw to claw,
          and Colossal Squids are known to hunt sperm whales. This tendency, commonly
          denoted deep sea gigantism, is counter-intuitive, as one would think that,
          the more pressure there is in the environment, the smaller creatures should
          be. However, surprisingly enough, pressure is not the main factor influencing
          the size of these animals, as they are mostly made of water and water is not
          very compressible. If anything, the buoyancy of water permits them to not have
          to fight against gravity and would allow them to become so large. Still,
          this does not quite answer why they are so big. To explain this confounding growth,
          two general rules exist: Kleiber’s rule and Bergmann’s rule. include pictures
          (japanese crab, colossal squid, other big fish)
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Found in the 1930s by biologist Max Kleiber, Kleiber’s rule, or Kleiber’s
          law, is an allometric law that stipulates that an animal’s metabolic rate,
          that is, the rate at which they process energy, is not in direct proportionality
          to their mass, but rather equal to 3/4 of it. For example, a cat is 100 times
          heavier than a mouse, but it will not have a metabolic rathe that is 100 times
          higher. Instead, it will only consume 32 times more energy. In other words,
          while it is true that bigger animals need more energy, they are also capable
          of using it more efficiently and lose less of it as heat. This is critical for
          creatures that live in an environment where food is very scarce and temperatures
          are near-freezing.

        <p>
          Bergmann’s rule, named after nineteenth century biologist Carl Bergmann, states
          that animals of larger size are most often found in colder regions of the globe.
          This is explained by the fact that larger animals have a lower surface-area-to-volume
          ratio, meaning that they radiate less heat per unit of mass, and his manage to stay
          warmer in cooler conditions. The opposite is usually true too: animals living in
          warmer climates will be of smaller size so as to reduce the amount of heat stored
          and maximize the cooling of the body through heat dissipation. For marine crustaceans,
          this trend translates to increased cell size and life span, though there is some
          debate in the scientific community over the validity of this “rule” (trend might be
          a more appropriate term), as there are many more factors that play into an organism’s
          body growth. Nonetheless, there is a definitive link between the unique deep sea
          environment and the size of its creatures.

        <h4>Bioluminescence</h4>
        <p>
          Bioluminescence is the process through which light is produced in an organism’s
          body due to a specific chemical reaction. This reaction occurs when the light-producing
          protein luciferin reacts with oxygen and, most often, the enzyme luciferaze that
          catalyzes, or speeds up, the reaction. There are, however, numerous types of luciferin,
          which vary depending on the organism. In marine bioluminescence, it is most common
          to find the luciferin coelenterazine at the centre of this reaction. In bioluminescent
          organisms, the cells that host the reaction are called photophores. Some creatures
          are able to synthesize their own light-producing protein from their diet, while others
          possess it thanks to the symbiotic bacteria living in their photophores. What is most
          interesting is that the photophores can range from a simple cluster of cells, like in
          the case of fireflies, to complex organs that include reflectors, colour filters, and
          lenses, as is visible in numerous deep sea marine creatures.

        <p>
          These animals can regulate quite closely their bioluminescence depending on their
          needs, which are either finding food, warding off predators, or searching for a mate.
          Thus, in deep sea environments, where sunlight is nonexistent, bioluminescence is of
          utmost importance and a crucial evolutionary skill that many organisms have developed.
          The lack of light also explains why the most common bioluminescent colour is blue— blue
          wavelengths are the ones that travel the furthest through water. Another notable
          bioluminescent colour is red. Red wavelengths stand on the complete opposite side of
          blue wavelengths on the electromagnetic visible light spectrum and travel the shortest
          distance through water. When used by deep sea organisms, red light serves as a sort of
          invisibility cloak, and, for some species, as a filter to identify prey and possible
          mates.

        <h4>Chemo synthesis</h4>
        <p>
          Since there is no light at the bottom of the ocean, photosynthesis is obviously
          not an option for organisms. So is the only way of obtaining organic carbon
          (the basis for glucose, and thus food and energy) to consume other organisms?
          Not so fast. While the most common and well-known autotrophs (organisms that
          form their organic substances from simple inorganic, or nonliving, substances)
          are plants and similar beings that perform photosynthesis, there exists another
          type: chemotrophs. Chemotrophs perform chemosynthesis, the process by which food
          is derived in the absence of sunlight from inorganic chemicals. The concept is
          quite similar to photosynthesis, but instead of taking CO2 from the atmosphere
          and using light as a power source to break it down, chemotrophs use, for example,
          hydrogen gas or hydrogen sulphide and use methane as the “power source”. the
          Chemosynthetic communities in the dee sea are typically found at hydrothermal
          vents or cold seeps.

          Hydrothermal vents are fissures are fissure in the Earth’s crust, from which
          geothermally heated water rich in sulphides flows. These are usually found
          near zones of high volcanic activity.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          Cold seeps are areas on the seabed where water rich in sulphides and methane leaks,
          often  forming a depression in the seabed where water with a salinity eight or ten
          times higher than normal ocean water accumulates (called a brine pool). Though
          the temperature of this water is the same as the surrounding environment, it is
          much colder in contrast to hydrothermal vents, which can reach up to 130 degrees.
