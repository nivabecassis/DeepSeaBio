          Of course, the sea provides resources to people all around the globe,
          be it in terms of food, energy, water, or commercial products, but when
          we think of the ocean as being bountiful, it is rarely the deep, dark
          abyss that comes to mind.

          Nonetheless, having explored a minuscule portion of it, scientists are
          certain that the deep sea still has mysteries waiting to be uncovered
          and treasures that, once brought to the surface, could change science
          as we know it. As explained by the National Ocean Service of the US
          National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on their website, “Ocean
          exploration… is not randomly wandering in hopes of finding something
          new. It is disciplined and organized and includes rigorous observations
          and documentation of biological, chemical, physical, geological, and
          archaeological aspects of the ocean.” With the findings done through
          deep sea exploration, current problems in the world can possibly be
          assessed, as well as emerging ones in the fields of medicine, environmental
          science, renewable clean energy, and so on. Some stipulate that
          further exploration of the deep sea could lead to better foresight of
          events such as earthquakes or tsunamis.

          Plus, seeing as humans have been sailing the seas for thousands of years
          now, it is no surprise that countless artifacts have sunk to the bottom
          of the sea, as victims of the waves, the weather, or other enemy boats
          in times of war. These relics could play a role in filling the gaps of
          history— a true goldmine for archaeologists.

          Not to mention more recent events may have landed aircrafts or ships
          in the ocean and in need of search and rescue missions. A good knowledge
          of the deep sea and how to navigate it properly would facilitate these
          expeditions and perhaps help save future lives.
